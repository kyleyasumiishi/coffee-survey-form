## New Web Development Concepts Learned

My goal for each freeCodeCamp project is simply to learn about and practice using new web development concepts and techniques.

Here's are new concepts I learned by building this project:

* HTML <code>main</code> element
* HTML dropdowns using the <code>select</code> and <code>option</code> tags
* HTML attributes for <code>input</code> elements, including the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> attributes for number inputs as well as the Boolean attributes <code>required</code> and <code>selected</code>
* Creating custom CSS variables
* Cascading CSS variables with the <code>:root</code> element
* Creating a gradual CSS linear gradient with the <code>linear-gradient</code> property
* CSS Flexbox's <code>flex-direction</code> property to create columns
* CSS Grid's <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-column-gap</code> to add columns and create column gaps

## Technologies Used
